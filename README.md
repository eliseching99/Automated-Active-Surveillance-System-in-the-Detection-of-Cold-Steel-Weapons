# Automated-Active-Surveillance-System-in-the-Detection-of-Cold-Steel-Weapons
In our final year project, we will be creating a website that will be able to provide and automatic real-time detection of cold steel weapon. In the event of a detection, the system will then alert the user through the website

We will be testing at least 4 of the following networks to detect the cold steel weapons:
1) YOLOV3-spp
2) YOLACT
3) CenterNet
4) CenterMask2

We have made our own dataset of cold steel weapons and will be using it as a factor in determining which networks we will use.
